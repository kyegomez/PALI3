"Figure 1: Overview of the PaLI-3 (5B) model: images are encoded into visual tokens individually
by the contrastively pretrained 2B SigLIP vision model. Along with a query, these visual tokens
are passed to an 3B encoder-decoder UL2 Transformer which produces the desired answer."



## Installation

`pip install pali3`


## Usage:


# License

# Todo

- [ ] Implement sig_lip vit model with training recipe
- [ ] Implement the text tokenizer, maybe use token monster 
- [ ] Implement the UL2 Transformer Encoder and Decoder
- [ ] Implement training scripts for the full pali3 model
